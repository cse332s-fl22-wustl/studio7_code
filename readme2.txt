What happens?
It tells us that all of the 5 numbers are correct and gives us the jackpot.

What can you learn from the exception message given when the program crashes?
Our program didn't crash :(

After we found the last mistake, the program works as it should. There was only one = in the if statement instead of ==.
we also had no array instantiated and thus no operations being taken place in the binary search. additionally, the
function was not correctly computing the middle of the array. It was only adding the nubmers instead of also dividing by 2
